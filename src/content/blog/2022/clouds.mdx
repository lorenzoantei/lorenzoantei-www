  <p class="text-2xl">The MILAN MACHINIMA FESTIVAL is the annual event showcasing audiovisual non-interactive works produced with video games otherwise known as machinima.</p>

My artwork is _Clouds_. It is a music video based on Fabrizio De André’s song “Le nuvole” created with Minecraft. It has been selected for screeming for the fifth edition of the festival.
