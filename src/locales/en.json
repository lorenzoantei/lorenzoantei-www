    "bio1": "I am an Italian computer artist.",
    "bio2": "My creative spark first lit up into empty spaces during university. Digital photograpy became my way to slow down time — to walk barefoot through reality, notice its cracks, its reflections, its fleeting glances. It grounded me while also opening portals. That tactile relationship with the world sparked a need to go deeper. I carried that curiosity with me into the academy, where it found room to grow.",
    "bio3": "I graduated in Net Art and Digital Cultures from the Accademia di Belle Arti di Carrara with the thesis <i>Catturare l'effimero - L’archivio come azione artivista - verso un’estetica dell’effimero</i> (2025).",
    "bio4": "I’ve taken part in numerous exhibitions, both in physical spaces and across the ether, pursuing a research path that blends irony, hacking, and critical intervention. I’ve created animatronics for theatrical performances, joined live coding nights with highly questionable Arduino-based hardware, and developed audiovisual experiences on the edge between performance and crash.",
    "bio5": "Alongside my practice, I collaborate with international entities such as Songlines Production, Omava Production and Lucca Crea (Lucca Comics & Games), handling media management and video editing for various projects... By day, I work as a full stack web developer at Quivi, building custom web applications.",
    "bio6": "I approach life as a constant flow, where the only certainty is the process of creating, evolving, and breaking things down to rebuild them again. <span class='glitchy delay-1'>Again.</span> <span class='glitchy delay-2'>And again.</span>",
