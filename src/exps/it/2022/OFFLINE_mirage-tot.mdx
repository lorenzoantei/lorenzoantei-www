(mi)rage - you’re in an empty place for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week
Generative video installation (audio and video)
Abstract

Social media shaped the way the Russian invasion was documented and the war added to the tide of usable content. The hyper-presence of gaseous contents constitutes an ephemeral experience that leaves an unfillable void. Social media is like a mirage, an optical illusion that fuels false expectations. The work attempts to capture the passive and distressing atmosphere caused by the fear of the missing out (F.O.M.O.).
