<Paragraph>
  After being kept in storage at MA*GA in Gallarate for 25 years, Giacomo Verde’s work Reperto Antropo-logico was selected to be exhibited during the second inauguration of the “Techno-Art and Interaction” section on September 2, 2022, as part of the exhibition Liberare Arte da Artisti at CAMeC in La Spezia. On behalf of the project management, I was entrusted with the task of carrying out a restoration of the work to make it once again accessible to the public. The intervention was received enthusiastically by CAMeC, which decided to feature it as part of the European Heritage Days, recognizing its relevance to the theme of sustainability. Indeed, the restoration fully adhered to Verde’s philosophy of reuse and open-source practices, striving to preserve as much of the original hardware as possible while implementing solutions based on open-source technologies to ensure the greatest possible accessibility.
